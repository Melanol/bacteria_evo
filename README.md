Evolutionary machine learning. Bacteria.

The faster you move, the more energy you consume. Food drops at random coordinates. Specimens mutate randomly.
To reproduce, a specimen needs to reach max energy, the resulting 2 new specimens have half of its max energy.
Redness of a specimen represents its speed, greenness - max energy.
